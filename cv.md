## Code example

This is an online calculator program.

```sh
let input1 = document.getElementById("number1");
let input2 = document.getElementById("number2");
```

We search for all elements through the function...

```sh
let arrayOperationButton = document.getElementsByClassName("operation-button");
function makeOperation(operationCode) {
    let number1 = Number(input1.value);
    let number2 = Number(input2.value);
    if (operationCode === "+") {
        let result = number1 + number2;
        window.alert(result);
    } else {
        if (operationCode === "-") {
            let result = number1 - number2;
            window.alert(result);
        }
        if(operationCode === "*"){
            let result = number1 * number2;
            window.alert(result);
        }
        if(operationCode==="/"){
            let result = number1 / number2;
            window.alert(result);
        }
        
    }
